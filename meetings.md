# FSE OpenScience Get-together

History of meetings

## 1st meeting (2019-11-20)

*Invitation text*

Did you ever read an article wishing the authors would make their data
and software available? Do you think reproducibility is a problem in
your field of research? Are you annoyed by open access fees?

Have you heard about open science, but would like to know more? Did you
always want to ask something about open science in an informal setting?
Or do you have strong opinions which you would like to share with others
at the Faculty of Science and Engineering?

  At which part of your workflow (from idea to publication) do you want to be more open and why?
